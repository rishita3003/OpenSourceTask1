I am enthusiastic about being a part of the coding club. I find coding logical and exciting which increases my interest in further.
Why should I contribute to open source?
I want to contribute to open source as it is very accessible and freely editable. It would allow us to make our changes in someone else's project too which might help in improving it. We can contribute in debugging of certain projects and codes or even work in the software which we are currently using. All these makes open source community very interactive and thus increases my interest to be a part of it.
