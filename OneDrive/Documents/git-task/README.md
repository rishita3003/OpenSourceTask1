I am enthusiastic about being a part of the coding club. I find coding logical and exciting which increases my interest in further.
Why should I contribute to open source?
I want to contribute to open source as it is very accessible and freely editable. This would allow us to make our changes in someone else's projects adn codes which might help in improving them, like debugging them or adding a new feature to it. We can even help in contributing in softwares which we currently use. All this maked open source community very interactive and increases my interest in it.
